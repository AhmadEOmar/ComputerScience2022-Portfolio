# Read me file for CS 370 Current/Emerging Trends in Computer Science
+ This is the read me file for my portfolio coursework in CS 370 where we were tasked to create a pathfinding AI in which a pirate learns inside of a maze to be able to find the treasure at the end of the maze.

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
+ We were provided a lot of sample code but the code that we had to create ourselves was the pathfinding code that the AI used to learn and get to the treasure at the end of the maze it was in.

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
+ Computer scientists are given a problem and are tasked with creating a software solution to that problem from either being a web-based application, mobile application, video game, and much more. The work of a computer scientist also must ensure that the software is secure with as little to no vulnerabilities, and ensure they are following laws surrounding their solution.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
+ I first am given a problem that I must solve and to do that I research potential solutions; I then break down the solution into manageable chunks that will allow me to work on the code in a way where I can ensure the code works but also has no issues before moving onto another chunk of the solution that I broke down, and by doing this it helps to ensure that I am within the constraints of the project but to also reach the timeline that would be put in place.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
+ We must ensure that our solution is secure so that no loopholes are available to hackers to be able to breach our data, we also must ensure that the privacy of our users and data is in place by using encryption so that in the unfortunate case of a data breach no users data will stole, and they stay secure. We also as computer scientists must think about how our work is being used in the ethical sense as well, in which we must ensure that our solution or code isn't used to break ethical concerns or is used to harm other people.
