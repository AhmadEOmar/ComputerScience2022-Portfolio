# CS 255 System Analysis & Design

This is a read me file for CS-255 Sstem Analysis & Design in which I answer questions about the project that I had to complete in this course. 


# Questions & Answers

1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? <br/><br/>
Our client the owner of DrivePass wants to have a web-based system designed to help train people taking the driving tests at the DMV. The owner of DrivePass wants to provide better training since they felt like people were not getting the proper training to pass the driving tests at the DMV. <br/><br/>  The client wanted us to create a web-based system that is run on a cloud server that could be accessed from anywhere at any time, the users could log into the web-based system, select a package that they wanted, and take the corresponding work that they have access to by the package they bought.  


2. What did you do particularly well? <br/><br/>
I think that I did a great job conveying what the client wanted and turning them into functional graphs that can be used to create the system. 

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? <br/><br/>
In my graphs while I did a great job conveying how the system should function, I did mess up with one of my graphs in which I stated for security purposes what when a user or admin tries to login to many times it will lock them out of the system to protect from brute force hacking. I had forgotten to state a number of times that they would get to try logging into the system. To fix this issue I would go back and instead of being vague with my answer I would have stated they have 3 chances before it they get locked out.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? <br/><br/>
When I was creating the UML graphs that we would be using for our client DrivePass I always went back to reference the interview that we did with the client so that I would always make sure that I was meeting the specifications that the client wanted us to develop for them. <br/> <br/> The reason it's so important to consider the client’s needs because they are hiring you as a professional to complete a project for them, if you ignore the needs of the client then you will be creating a system that they did not ask for and that does not match what they need the system to do.

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? <br/> <br/>
The way that I approached designing the systems for DrivePass was to first read over the interview that we had with our client, after making sure that I had a good grasp on what the client wanted I then broke the system down into a few parts to make it more manageable to understand what needs to be done. I first started with an activity diagram in which we showed a general overview on how the system functions, after finishing the activity diagram I then broke the system down even more into how a customer would log into the system and what they are able to do, after that I moved over to the admin and showing what they could do and had access to, and then the workers and how they could use the system and what they could access. <br/><br/> The biggest strategy that I will be using in the future is to break down a system into manageable parts in which I can work on each section to make sure that each part is meeting the specifications that were requested of us to create for the client.
