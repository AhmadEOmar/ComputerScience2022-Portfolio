# Read me file for CS 360 Mobile Architect & Programming 
+ This is the read me file for my portfolio coursework in CS 360 where we were tasked to create an Android Application using Android Studio with Java and SQLite for the database.

# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
+ The application that I selected was to create an inventory management application in which the user is first able to login or create an account and then they should be able to add, edit, and delete items from the inventory application that we created, and if an item reaches zero it should send a text notification to the user informing them they ran out of that item.
+ When the user tries to log into the application, we should check to ensure that they are an actual user and to ensure that they have input information into the username and password field.
+ When the user tries to create an account, we want to ensure they are able to create a unique username and if that username is used already to let them know that username exists and if they used it to sign in with that existing username, we also ensure that the user has input information in all required fields.



# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
+ There were quite a few screens that were needed to create this application.
+ Login Screen - where we checked to ensure that the information used to login matches what our database has and if it's correct allow the user to login.
+ Create Account - Where we asked the user to create an account with a username and password.
+ Inventory Page - Where the user can add, edit, delete items which will update in the database and show in the userâ€™s inventory page. There is also an SMS button to get permission to send text notifications to the user, as well as a logout button to send the user back to the sign in page.
+ Add Item Page - Add's items to the database which will be display in the inventory page.
+ Edit Item Page - Allows the user to edit the item's name and amount they have of that item which will update in the database and update in the inventory page.
+ Delete Item Page - Allows the user to delete the item from the database which removes the item from the inventory page.
+ I created a design document that I used to ensure that I had everything planned before creating any of these pages and features to ensure that I don't forget anything but that I also make sure that I am able to navigate the application easily and everything is easy to use while making sense to the user. 


# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
+ I broke everything down into the features that I needed and then did research on how I can implement those features before I started coding. By doing this I ensured that I stayed within scope of my program while also having general knowledge on how to code this application, and the reason I went with this approach is that I have not touched Java in a while so I was very rusty with its features and on how to do things so I had to use Google, StackOverflow, and YouTube to read up and watch tutorials on how to get my application working. 

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
+ I ensured to test my application every time I added something to it where I tested a feature before moving onto another feature to ensure that I fixed anything wrong before moving on. This helped ensure that my application was working as intended but also helped me to ensure that any bugs or issues that I had were fixed before doing anything else, this process is always important to do since not testing an application can led to bugs that could lead to data breaches or lowering your reputation since your application is a buggy mess. 


# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
+ I ran into a lot of issues with Android Studio since this was my first time using it and as I stated above it's been a while since I have even touched Java, so I had to keep reading documentation or looking into StackOverflow posts or YouTube videos to understand how to do things in Android Studio and Java.
+ Another issue that I ran into was me creating the design of the application, I know that I'm not an artistically inclined person so I ran into a lot of issues with a design and the design I did go with feels a bit cheap and generic which could cause issues with users thinking my application is a cheap or not as good as other applications that are designed by professionals. 


# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
+ Honestly, I feel like everything since I had never used Android Studio and have not touched Java in about 6-7 years so being able to create an actual functional application felt like an accomplishment. By also being able to create an application I showed that I can use new technologies and within a few weeks I am able to create a functional application.
