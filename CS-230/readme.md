# Executive Summary
The client company The Gaming Room is wanting to develop a web-based game of their current game Draw It or Lose It but need help streamlining the development. The Gaming Room wants the web-based game of Draw It or Lose it to run on multiple platforms in which the game will be played by the application rendering images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. The game will have multiple teams consisting of multiple people if the teams are unable to guess the image before time expires the teams will get one final guess each to solve the puzzle within a 15 second time limit, the game and team name must be unique, and only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. Draw It or Lose It is currently only an app only on Android Phones.

# Evaluation
| Development Requirements  | Mac | Linux | Windows | Mobile Devices |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| Server Side  | **Advantages** <br/> By using MacOS Server it will allow the user to create and set up features that will be compatible with all Mac software’s which is easier than on a Windows Server. It is upgradable to match the size that is trying to be achieved.Mac is the second costliest server cost as well as having the highest components costs compared to Windows and Linux.For the server-side code which will interact with the front-end where we can get the users login information, and where the database is stored, we can use multiple languages for this whichever language they prefer could be used. We could use Rails with Ruby, Django written in python, or Laravel written in PHP. <br/> <br/> **Disadvantages** <br/> Harder to use in certain instances than both Linux and Windows servers. Runs on a small set of hardware which can limit options. <br/> <br/> **Verdict** <br/> Since MacOs Servers are the second highest cost and being the most expensive with having to buy Apple components such as Mac computers to run it. We would not recommend it as the server of choice for The Gaming Room web-application. | **Advantages** <br/> By using a Linux server we get a server that is known for its stability so that we don’t have to worry about the server needing to be restarted, we also get security with Linux servers being one of the most secure servers, Linux is free and open source allowing you to study what exactly it’s doing on the machine, and finally the cost of a Linux server is cheaper than both Windows and Mac. Finally the price to use Linux as a server is relatively cheap in which the server can be run without any cost besides having to buy the system components to run the server. This is since Linux is open source. For the server-side code which will interact with the front-end where we can get the users login information, and where the database is stored, we can use multiple languages for this whichever language they prefer could be used. We could use Rails with Ruby, Django written in python, or Laravel written in PHP. <br/> <br/> **Disadvantages** <br/> The disadvantages of a Linux system are that it’s more complex than both Windows and Mac which will require someone with more experience to work on it, another disadvantage is that Linux does not have as dedicated support as Windows. <br/> <br/> **Verdict** <br/> Linux is a good operating system for a server. We would honestly recommend either going with a Linux or Windows server. The reason to go with Linux as stated above is that license fee for the server is free since Linux is open source, and Linux uses the same components as Windows. | **Advantages** <br/> The advantages to using a Windows server is that they are the easiest to setup, the easiest to configure, and the easiest to do support on. Unlike with Linux and Mac there are plenty of experienced people that can work on a windows server since it’s more common. Finally, there is plenty of third-party applications and hardware support to help point in on what you are trying to achieve. Out of all the operating systems servers Windows is the priciest due to the cost of the server license to buy. Windows does offer the ability to lease the server. You can buy the standardFor the server-side code which will interact with the front-end where we can get the users login information, and where the database is stored, we can use multiple languages for this whichever language they prefer could be used. We could use Rails with Ruby, Django written in python, or Laravel written in PHP.<br/> <br/> **Disadvantages** <br/> The disadvantages for using Windows Servers are the initial licensing costs and ongoing support costs. Windows servers can have performance issues depending on what is it’s being used for. Finally, since windows is the more popular OS more chances of getting a virus or attacks. <br/> <br/> **Verdict** <br/>Windows is also a good choice for an operating system even though it has the highest cost for the server, but by paying that price you get dedicated support. It is also the easiest to set up an configure. | **verdict** <br/> We would recommend not using mobile devices for this. While it can be done it's not worth the time and effort when you can get either Windows or Linux for your server needs.|

# Recommendations
Analyze the characteristics of and techniques specific to various systems architectures and make a recommendation to The Gaming Room. Specifically, address the following:

1. **Operating Platform:** In my professional experience I would recommend that The Gaming Room go with a Window platform. This is due to multiple reasons, first is that Windows has the most support compared to Linux, and while the cost is more than Linux, the complexity is a lot simpler to get everything set up and working. This will allow The Gaming Room to have an easier time finding experienced developers it will be much easier than trying to find the same experienced developers on Linux, the Windows platform has dedicated support that you will get from a single place Microsoft unlike with Linux where you must find which vendor they have and contacting them for support. This makes it much easier since everything is in one place with Microsoft who has dedicated support for Windows platform. Finally, Microsoft constantly updates both the operating and servers’ platforms that they support which will help with security, and reliability. 

2. **Operating Systems Architectures:** Window comes with two architecture types, 32-bit, and 64-bit. Everything that window does involves a GUI that are relatively easy to understand and follow this makes it so even people inexperienced with windows is able to use it easily most Windows systems. Now-a-days most systems are on 64-bit unless The Gaming Room decides to run older operating system, we would not recommend this as this comes with unsupported operating platforms which will have security risks. I would recommend going with a 64-bit operating system architecture since that architecture style is faster and more secure than a 32-bit operating system, this will help us by allowing data to be transferred at a faster rate and by association this will allow our server to run faster. By having these optimizations in place, we are making our server system much faster which in turn will help everything else in an overall improvement. 

3. **Storage Management:** Windows comes with a variety of features to help with storage management from storage sense which works with OneDrive to automatically free up space, they can also manage storage manually by going to into a GUI showing all current applications that are on the system and inside that GUI you can uninstall or locate where applications are stored, and finally by using Windows are able to tell applications and files where it can be stored by an easy to use file management system. For the server I would recommend SSDs as the recommended storage choice since it’s able to read and write data at a faster pace, this will allow our servers to gather stored information faster and allow us to send the images to the website faster. The SSD should also be relatively large so that we have room to expand on the images we use for the game, if we don’t have enough space we will run into issues down the line where we will need to take the server offline to change this, and this will result in a large downtime where the users are unable to use the website. 

4. **Memory Management:** Since we are going to have many images to use in the game, we can either create a library of images or a database of images on the server by using the memory allocation such as cache memory. This will allow us easy storage onto the server, allowing them to keep the entire project together in a secure area of the computer and give it easy access to the server to retrieve the images for the game when the server calls for the images are called from the database to the website. For the memory on the server, I would recommend DDR4 memory which is the currently most available RAM that will allow us to have faster speed of communication from the server to the website hosting the game and calling the images. I would also recommend that the server have a powerful CPU as this will help boost performance so that we can make sure the server has the speed and power it will need to host all the users on the website. Since we are going to be hosting a website that will be dealing with a lot of users accessing the site at once, and since we don’t really have an exact number of concurrent users it will be hard to give an exact recommendation of how much we will need. I would recommend between 128gbs to 256gbs of RAM inside of the server, the reason I state having this much is that it will give us plenty of room to expand and allow more users onto the website and like I said earlier since we don’t have an exact number for the concurrent users we would want more RAM to make sure that everything is covered since having less RAM will slow down access to the website and if we don’t have enough RAM at the start we will need to bring down the server to add more to it. 

5.	**Distributed Systems and Networks:** Our distributed system will be our front-end which is the website they create for the users to play the game. The user will then communicate with our backend system which is the server where all the images are stored, the images will then be called from the server to the front-end to be used in the game here is where having a powerful server will help since it will handle the information being called as well as how many users are able to access and play on the website. The way the users will communicate with the server will be by doing calls from our front-end website, when they log in it will send a call over to our server which will authenticate them, as well as they are playing the game the calls will be going to our database where the images are stored or in the RAM where the images have already been called. From there it will send the call request back to the front-end website where the user will be able to play Draw it or lose it, there are downsides to doing a communication like this is that our game will only work for those who are online and is unable to be played offline since no data is stored on the website, another potential drawback is if the servers get turned off the entire website will be unreachable. There are ways to get around an outage is to have generators that will be turned on in the case of a power outage where we can then send a notification to the users saying the game is going under maintenance till the power is turned back on.

6. **Security:** Since Windows is the most popular operating system it is most likely to have attacks on it but by following recommended IT security procedure you can make your system just as secure as a Linux server. Window also comes with built in security tools; windows also pushed out updates regularly that help patch any vulnerabilities that are found. Window systems also have plenty of third-party tools and support that work in tandem with Windows to help mitigate any others security concerns that could be an issue.
