# Cplusplus-Program
C++ work from my bachelors degree in computer science


1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  The aim of this program is to show proficiency in using two programming languages to solve a problem, we are to use C++ and Python to create a program that will take user input and then outputs the desired outcomes. 

  We created a corner grocer application that takes a file and reads the data inside the file to create a list of how many times items were bought in the store, search for a specific item inside the list and then outputs the amount of times the item was bought, and then to create a histogram by reading information from another file that read the amount of times an item was bought and printing out *’s for each item bought and then outputting it onto the console. 


2. What did you do particularly well?

  I was able to meet all the requirements of the project and incorporated C++ and Python really well.


3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  I need to do input validation for when the user is given the options to pick from, if the user uses a string or char the program will just close instead of telling them that the input only accepts integers as inputs from the user. 

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

  In the program for user validation for when the user picks option 2 for searching the file for a specific item in which the items are stored by the first letter being capitalized and the following letters are lower case. If the user for example inputted pears as the search term the code would say that item was bought 0 times because the file stores it as Pears so the code, I wrote would capitalize the first input from the user and then makes the rest of the letters lower case. 

  For example, if they user typed in PEARS the program would re-write it into Pears which would match the file and then print out it was bought 8 times. Even if they typed pEARS it would fix that and make it match the file so that the inputs would always work. I had to find out how to loop through the string we take from the user and then make the first letter capital and then make the rest of the letters all lowercase this took a bit of research, but I was able to find one tutorial to make the first letter capital and then I looked for another tutorial to making the rest of the lowercase. I then took the two and modified them and combined them together to make it work for my program. 

The code for this is down below

	void toUpper(string& str)
	{
		if (str.length() == 0)
		{
			return;
		}

		// Makes the first letter of the word upper case. 
		str[0] = std::toupper(str[0]);

		// For loop that will make the rest of the word input into lower case.
		for (int i = 1; i < str.length(); i++)
		{
			str[i] = std::tolower(str[i]);
		}
	}


5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

  The skills that will transfer over is the ability to work with multiple programming languages inside the same application, as well as the ability of how I search for answers the to questions I have about code I’m trying to implement or how certain features work with the programming language I’m using at the time by either reading documentation or browsing stackoverflow to gain insight from the knowledge of people who have more experience than I do. 


6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  The Program is broken apart into different functions so that instead of a long main where all the code is in one section making it unreadable, I have the program broken into smaller functions that make it easier to follow the logic and see where something would break if anything does happen. I have also included a lot of comments to help others who look at my program to see what I was thinking at the time and trying to achieve. 

The code can easily be adapted to have the user input the name of the file that they want to read and still work the same since with a few changes to accommodate for the input of information like that but once that is done the program will be able to run the same code to do the same outputs. 


Demo Below
----------------------------------

Take input from the user and output the desired effect

When the user input is 1, output the number of times items were bought by reading the file with the information

When the user inputs 2, reads the input and searches the file for the number of times the specific item was bought.

When the user inputs 3, read the number of times items were bought and showcase it in a histogram. This is done by reading the information from the frequency.dat file
