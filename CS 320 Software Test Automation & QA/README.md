# Read me file for CS 320 Software Test Automation & QA
+ This is the read me file for my portfolio coursework in CS 320 in which I talk about my process for how I ensured my work was of quality and the practices that I used to ensure that quality. I have uploaded my project 1 coursework that wanted us to create and test our software to ensure that we were hitting all test cases that were given to us in our rubric, and also my summary and reflection of my work in our project 2 file.

# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? 
+ By doing very extensive testing as I was creating the program, I was able to ensure that my software was functional and secure, and the way that I accomplished this was as I created the program, I would test the software that I had written before moving onto the next section of the code. By doing this I was able to test each section extensively before moving on and it helped by making sure the code written was working as intended, and if for some reason the code was not acting as intended I knew about it right away and could work on it while my memory was fresh about that section of code instead of creating the entire program and forgetting what the issue was in that area.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program? 
+ User needs or the userâ€™s requirements are important and the way I ensured that they were meet was to always look back at my rubric which had the requirements we needed to meet. I would always double check the rubric to ensure that my software was meeting what the user wanted and I always ensured by testing that I was meeting what the user wanted.

# How do I approach designing software? 
+ As I stated above in my prior questions my approach to designing the software so to first read over the rubric to see what was required of me, and then right after that I would start writing the code section by section and then I would test right away so that I can ensure that the code was working as intended before moving on but also to ensure that I was meeting the requirements that were asked of me. By doing this I was able to ensure that I was focusing on each section with my full attention and that everything was working correctly before I moved onto the next section where I would do the same process over and over till, I got the software completed.
