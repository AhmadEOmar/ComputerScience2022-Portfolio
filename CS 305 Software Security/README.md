# Read me for CS 305 Software Security 
+ This is the read me file for my portfolio submission for CS 305 in which I submitted my project 1 Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment and project 2 Artemis Financial Practices for Secure Software Report in which I looked into the needs of our client Artemis Financial and helped them with security recommendations but also by looking through their code to ensure that there is no out of date frameworks being used that can cause security issues.
+ In this read me file I will also be answering a few set questions about my thought process and what I was doing for Artemis Financial exactly.
