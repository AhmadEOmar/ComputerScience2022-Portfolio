# Read me file for CS 330 Computer Graphics & Visualization
+ This is the read me file for CS 330 Computer Graphics & Visualization in which we worked through creating a 2D object that we took a picture of and making that into a 3D image by using C++ and the OpenGL library to create the 3D scene. I decided to recreate a scene of my desktop since I use it so much and it's something that I look at every day, I originally was going to have more objects such as my microphone, headset, and my mouse but I ran out of time with creating the keyboard since I had to keep going back and forth with the placement of the keys.
+ Down below is an included image on how final scene looks like

# How do I approach designing software?
1. What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
   - It's helped me with breaking down a 2D scene and on how I can convert it to a 3D scene using C++ and OpenGL, it also helped me to get a better grasp about a 3D environment compared to a 2D environment in which I had to account for the z axis instead of just x and y. I also learned how to break down an object into triangles to create the objects that I would need in my scene and how I had to account for the different faces of the object I am creating such as the front of my desktop and every angle it has.  

2. What design process did you follow for your project work?
   - I first created a design document on all the objects that I would try to create in my scene and broke them down into the basic shapes I could use to accomplish them, as we progressed through the class I focused on what was due that week such as creating lighting, textures, and a camera that moves, when we got to the final week I worked on the objects that I could create and found out that I would not be able to create everything within a reasonable time so I decided to omit some things like my microphone, headsets, and mouse and worked more on getting my keyboard to look as good as possible since that was the most complex object to create and took the most amount of time to finish. 

3. How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
   - Honestly the tactic I took can work on normal programming as well in which I create pseudocode to break down what I am creating and then to work on them in chunks to get it finished on time. It also helped me to learn how to cut back on some objects/features that I can't create at a reasonable pace and to either reduce them or work on them later where I have more time to work on them.

     

# How do I approach developing programs?

1. What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
   - This was honestly the first time I've ever worked on objects in a 2D and 3D scene so this all was a learning experience in which I had to learn strategies on the fly in which I had to read up on documentations and watching tutorials to learn how to do certain things with C++ and OpenGL. 

2. How did iteration factor into your development?
   - When we first started this class, I just did the most basic things that I could such as following along with learnopengl and copying the things they were doing but as time went on and I learned more about OpenGL I started to do things in my way which took a bit of time since I am honestly still learning about OpenGL. 

3. How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
   - Like I stated above I used to follow the tutorials on learnopengl but as time went by and I watched more tutorials on the subject and seeing how the people in the tutorials made their code more modular I followed their approach which helped save me time since I would be calling in functions instead of having to type everything out. This saves me time but also allows me to reuse code anywhere in my project easily which helped to get my code done faster and allowing me more time to work on my scene and objects that I needed to create.



 # How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

1. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
   - I would say that having that time constraint helps with my future classes since I learned how to manage a skill that I did not know anything about and be able to meet the weekly deadlines and learning how to search for information on my topic to learn how to fix the issues I was running into with the time constraint that I had.


2. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
   - I want to follow my dreams as a kid and go into the video game industry to at least follow my dreams and try everything instead of moving away from it due to the stigma of working in the video game industry. By learning the skills by using OpenGL it will help me if I ever need to create a custom game engine but also helped me with learning more and visualizing a 2D and 3D space when working with objects but most of the tools that we are using here will also transition into the video game industry which will give me a better ability to work in that space. 
   - I also always wanted to try creating my own game engine so by learning the skills in this class I can better understand any tutorial that I watch about creating a game engine which thankfully I will be doing my own time which will allow me to fix all the issues I ran into this class with the time constraint that we had.
